# Welcome to My Personal Website! 👋  

Hi there! I'm **Juan Echeverria**, and this is the repository for my personal portfolio and resume website, hosted at [jecheverria5252.com](https://jecheverria5252.com).  

## 🌟 About This Website  
This site serves as a **digital portfolio** where I showcase my work, projects, and professional background. It's built as a **static website** and hosted using **GitHub Pages**, with extra security and performance handled by **Cloudflare**.  

## 🔒 Security & Performance  
To keep this site secure and running smoothly, I’ve implemented:  
- **🔐 HTTPS encryption** (via Cloudflare) for secure browsing  
- **🛡️ DDoS protection** to prevent malicious attacks  
- **🤖 Bot filtering** to block scrapers and unwanted traffic  

## 🚀 How It Works  
Whenever I update my site:  
1. I **push changes** to the `main` branch of this repository.  
2. **GitHub Pages** automatically updates the live website.  
3. **Cloudflare handles security** and optimizes page loading speed.
