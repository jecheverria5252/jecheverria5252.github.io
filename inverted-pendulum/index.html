  <h1>Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) for Inverted Pendulum</h1>

  <p>
    This project applied a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) to stabilize an inverted pendulum on a cart system.
    Using Newtonian physics, the nonlinear dynamics of a 2-DOF system (cart position and pole angle) were
    derived and linearized to form state-space equations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Three simulation cases were run in MATLAB/Simulink to observe how different Q and R weightings in the cost
    function impacted system performance:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Case 1 (Baseline):</strong> Identity matrix Q and small R value. Smooth motion reaching the target in ~4s.</li>
    <li><strong>Case 2 (Fast Response):</strong> Lowered Q velocity weight. System reached 10m twice as fast with higher control effort.</li>
    <li><strong>Case 3 (High R):</strong> Large R value reduced control effort but failed to reach the final position in 10s.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The simulation demonstrated how LQR can be tuned to prioritize speed, accuracy, or energy efficiency by
    adjusting Q and R. The optimal gains were calculated using MATLAB's <code>lqr()</code> function, and
    step responses were evaluated in Simulink.

    This project laid a foundation for advanced control topics like LQG and Kalman filtering.
    It highlights the power of model-based control design when system dynamics are well-understood.
