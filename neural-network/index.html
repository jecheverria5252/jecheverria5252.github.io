  <h1>Sequence-to-Sequence Neural Network for Control Systems</h1>

  <p>
    This project explored the use of Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) neural network architectures
    to model and predict control outputs in closed-loop temperature regulation systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Traditional PID controllers were compared to data-driven models trained on time-series
    temperature and control signal data. The neural networks learned to predict future control actions
    based on historical sequences of input-output data.
  </p>

  <p>
    Highlights include:
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented encoder-decoder models in TensorFlow/Keras</li>
      <li>Preprocessed time-series control system data for sequence learning</li>
      <li>Trained models to improve temperature regulation stability</li>
      <li>Evaluated model performance against traditional control strategies</li>
    </ul>
