  <h1>Forecasting Control Signals with Attention</h1>

  <p>This project explores how machine learning can be used to forecast control signals in a temperature system. Instead of reacting to changes like traditional controllers, our model learns from past behavior to predict what comes next.</p>

  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>In systems like heating or cooling, predicting the right control input can improve efficiency and stability. Traditional feedback controllers (like PID) work well, but they donâ€™t learn. Neural networks with attention mechanisms can improve on this by using memory of past errors to make smarter predictions.</p>

  <h2>The Approach</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Input: a sequence of temperature errors (how far off from the target)</li>
    <li>Output: a sequence of control signals (how much heat to apply)</li>
    <li>Model 1: a basic GRU sequence model</li>
    <li>Model 2: the same model with an attention mechanism</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Training and Results</h2>
  <p>The model was trained on over 5,000 data points from a simulated control system. The attention-based model was more accurate and stable compared to the baseline. It learned when to focus on certain parts of the input to make better predictions.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Using attention helps neural networks make better predictions in control systems. This approach shows potential for improving performance in real-world tasks like climate control, energy systems, or robotics where forecasting control inputs matters.</p>
